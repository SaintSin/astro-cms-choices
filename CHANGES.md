### Persistent fetch-failure streak per site

- Investigated whether `pnpm detect` logs a total count of attempts against unreachable domains — it didn't: no run-end summary, and no cumulative counter anywhere. The only prior visibility was `db:report --errors`, which only looks at a rolling window (default last 5 scans), not lifetime history
- Ad-hoc query against the 59 scans on file turned up 818 domains with at least one error, 14,237 total wasted fetch attempts across them, and 189 domains that have errored in _every_ scan they've ever appeared in (some 57/57)
- Added a real `consecutive_errors` column on `sites` (`scripts/db-utils.ts`) — increments on every `Error` result, resets to 0 on any success. One-time backfill computes each site's actual current streak from existing scan history on migration, so long-dead domains start accurately (e.g. 57) instead of at 0 and needing another 57 scans to "catch up"
- Verified the write-time logic with a synthetic test against a throwaway DB copy (not the real one): simulated one more error (57 → 58), then a success (→ 0) — confirmed the increment/reset behaves exactly as intended, without needing a full multi-thousand-site `pnpm detect` run just to exercise two lines of logic
- New `pnpm db:report -- --fail-streak` (`--min` to raise the threshold, default 5) lists sites currently failing every attempt since their last success, with the streak length, last error message, and last-checked date

### PSI — Agentic Browsing category support

- Google's PageSpeed Insights API added a new Lighthouse category, `AGENTIC_BROWSING` (confirmed live via the `$discovery/rest?version=v5` doc and a direct API call) — covers `agent-accessibility-tree`, three `webmcp-*` audits, `cumulative-layout-shift`, and `llms-txt`
- `scripts/psi.mjs`: added `agentic-browsing` to the requested categories; new `agenticBrowsing()` parser counts passed vs. applicable audits (Lighthouse's own ≥0.9 "green" threshold), skipping `notApplicable` ones (most sites won't implement WebMCP forms, so those 3 audits are usually N/A). New columns `agentic_score`, `agentic_passed`, `agentic_applicable` on `psi_results`, migration-safe via the existing `ALTER TABLE` try/catch pattern
- Displayed as `passed/applicable` (e.g. `2/2`, `1/3`) rather than a 0-100 score — matches how PSI's own UI shows this category, since most of its audits are conditionally not-applicable and a percentage would be misleading. `src/pages/psi.astro` gets a new sortable "Agentic" column in both the Mobile and Desktop groups, colour-coded the same as the other score columns; intentionally excluded from the existing `/800` total (it's not a comparable 0-100 score)
- Verified live against `astro-what-cms.netlify.app`: `2/2` on both strategies, green, sorts correctly; historical rows correctly show `—` until re-scanned

### PSI — concurrent fetching (was ~1 day for a full run)

- Root cause: `psi.mjs` fetched sites strictly sequentially. A single PSI request blocks for the full remote Lighthouse run (~22s observed) — the 700ms inter-request delay was never the bottleneck, sequential execution was (~4,600 jobs × 22s ≈ a full day, matching the reported runtime)
- Added `--concurrency=<N>` (default 2): jobs are split into one queue per strategy, each strategy gets its own pool of `N` workers pulling from that queue, so mobile and desktop always run in parallel rather than one strategy idling once the other's queue empties. Default is 2 workers × 2 strategies = 4 concurrent requests, matching what was asked for
- better-sqlite3 is synchronous and Node is single-threaded, so the concurrent workers never race on the shared `insertResult` statement — each `.run()` call completes atomically before the next worker's turn. Verified via a live 6-site test run: 12 jobs, visibly interleaved completion order (proof of real concurrency, not relabeled sequential output), 12/12 rows written with zero collisions, 1.3 min vs. the ~4.4 min the old sequential estimate would predict
- Startup banner now prints `Concurrency: N workers × M strategies = total`, and the time estimate accounts for the per-strategy queue length divided by worker count rather than the flat job count
- README: full-run estimate corrected from ~100 min (sequential) to ~25 min (default 4-way concurrency)

### `astro-llms-md` added

- Installed `astro-llms-md@2.2.2` and wired it into `astro.config.mjs`, configured the same way as the `historyofphuket.com-astro` reference project (`llmsTxt({ generateMarkdown: true })`, positioned between `sitemap()` and `robotsTxt()`)
- Verified via `pnpm build`: generates `dist/llms.txt`, `dist/llms-full.txt`, and one `.md` per page (index, insights, crux, psi — 404 excluded by the integration's default excludes) with no build-time issues despite the large PSI table
- Fixed a stale site-count while in there: `index.astro`'s meta description and OG alt text said "2,600+" / "2,633 scanned, 2,133 confirmed" — corrected to the current "2,700+" / "2,732 scanned, 2,282 confirmed"

### OG cards — Agentic Browsing, live stats, and a real generation script

- `og-card-psi.html`: added a 5th pill and subtitle mention for Agentic Browsing (cyan, matching the colour already used for framework/agentic badges elsewhere), refreshed all four stat numbers and the bar-strip
- `psi.astro`'s lead paragraph now links "Agentic Browsing" to `developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/agentic-browsing/scoring`
- Regenerating the actual PNG used to be a fully manual process (no script existed — the CHANGES.md history says the originals were "generated via Playwright screenshot" as a one-off). Built `scripts/generate-og-cards.mjs` to make this repeatable:
  - All three `og-card*.html` files tokenized with `{{TOKEN}}` placeholders in place of hardcoded numbers (stat values and bar-strip `flex` values)
  - The script computes live stats from `cms-results.json` (home card) and `.scan-history.db` (CrUX and PSI cards — reusing the same "latest run per site per strategy/form-factor" query pattern already established in `db-report.ts` and the page components), substitutes them into the HTML in memory, and renders with Playwright (`page.setContent()` + screenshot — no dev server needed) at the templates' native 1200×630
  - Installed `playwright` as a proper devDependency (previously only ever pulled ad-hoc via `npx`) plus the Chromium browser binary
  - Found and fixed a real bug while building it: the token substitution applied `.toLocaleString()` (comma-formatting) unconditionally, including inside `flex: {{TOKEN}}` CSS — `flex: 1,902` is invalid CSS and silently drops the flex-basis, which broke the PSI card's bar-strip (only the third/remainder segment rendered). Fixed with a first substitution pass targeting `flex: {{TOKEN}}` specifically (raw integer), before the general pass that comma-formats everything else (visible stat text)
  - `pnpm generate:og-cards` (optionally `-- --card=home|crux|psi`) regenerates all three; verified visually — all three cards render correctly with current live numbers
- Moved the three templates out of `public/` into `scripts/og-templates/`: they were being copied verbatim into `dist/` (Astro ships everything under `public/` as-is) and were publicly reachable at e.g. `/og-card-psi.html`, despite never being served over HTTP by anything — the generator script reads them directly via `readFileSync` + `page.setContent()`, not by navigating to a URL. `biome.json`'s `files.includes` updated with a `!scripts/og-templates` exclusion, since the `{{TOKEN}}` placeholder syntax isn't valid HTML and fails Biome's parser outright — a per-file `linter.enabled: false` override wasn't enough, since parse errors are reported before overrides apply; only a full `files.includes` exclusion skips parsing entirely. Verified: `pnpm build` no longer emits `og-card*.html` into `dist/`, `pnpm check` is clean, generator still works from the new path

### Detection — attribute-order bugs ported back from `astralcoders.com`

- `scripts/detect-cms.ts`'s rule engine was ported into `astralcoders.com` as a live single-URL checker; two bugs found and fixed there are now ported back so the next `pnpm detect` scan picks them up
- Fixed 20 generator-meta-tag rules (WordPress, Ghost, Drupal, Joomla, Craft CMS, Kirby, TYPO3, Statamic, Webflow, Squarespace, Wix, HubSpot, Starlight, Hugo, Eleventy, Jekyll, Gatsby, Hexo, VitePress, Umbraco) that used an attribute-order-sensitive regex (`/<meta[^>]+generator[^>]*NAME/i`) requiring `generator` to appear before the CMS name — failed on any site whose HTML has `content` before `name` (e.g. webflow.com ships `<meta content="Webflow" name="generator"/>`). Switched all of them to the existing order-agnostic `hasGeneratorTag()` helper, previously only used by Astro/Starlight detection. HubSpot's compound rule split into `hasGeneratorTag(html, /HubSpot/i) || /name="hub-spot-id"/i.test(html)`
- Fixed Webflow's `wf-page`/`wf-site` rule: was checking for a meta tag (`/<meta[^>]+name="wf-(?:page|site)"/i`) that Webflow doesn't emit — it actually sets `data-wf-page`/`data-wf-site` as attributes on `<html>`. Now `/data-wf-(?:page|site)=/i`
- Verified against live sites while building the original fix: `webflow.com` (was `Unknown`, now correctly `Webflow`/`page-builder`/`high`), `wordpress.org` (unaffected — already had a non-meta fallback path), `astralcoders.com` and `curryphuket.com` (both correctly Astro, no CMS)

## 2026-07-09

### Home page performance — PSI 80 → 100/100/100/100 (desktop), 98 mobile

- Root cause: `ShowcaseTable.astro` rendered all 2,732 results into the live DOM on every load, and the client filter/sort script (`index.astro`) re-`appendChild`'d all 2,732 rows plus toggled `hidden` on all 2,732 rows on every `applyView()` call — forced reflow, ~1.7s of Style & Layout work, and a ~3s LCP element render delay that had nothing to do with fonts or network
- Extracted per-row markup into `ShowcaseRow.astro` (Astro scopes `<style>` per-component, so this was required before splitting the markup) — only `results.slice(0, pageSize)` (50 rows) renders into the live `<tbody>`; the remaining ~2,682 rows sit inside a `<template id="all-rows-template">`, parsed but never laid out or style-computed by the browser until JS moves rows out of it
- `applyView()` rewritten: `allRows` is now built once from both the live tbody and the template's inert content; the old reorder-loop + per-row `hidden` toggle is replaced with a single `tbody.replaceChildren(...pageRows)` per view update
- Confirmed in-browser: 50 live rows / 2,682 inert / 904 total DOM nodes on initial load (was ~15–20k); pagination, sort, and search all verified working against the new structure
- `astro.config.mjs`: added `build: { inlineStylesheets: "always" }` — the two small render-blocking stylesheets (2.6 + 4.7 KiB) are now inlined into `<head>` instead of separate blocking requests (`"auto"` wasn't enough — `BaseLayout.css` at 4.7 KiB sits just above the default 4 KB auto-inline threshold)
- Removed the dead `document.addEventListener("astro:page-load", initDetector)` — `ClientRouter` was removed from the project (replaced with native CSS `@view-transition { navigation: auto; }`), so that event no longer fires; the plain top-level `initDetector()` call is sufficient since navigations are full page loads again
- Mobile (98/100, Slow 4G): remaining gap is ~220 KiB of inert-template markup that still costs network transfer time even though it costs zero layout/CPU — 99.3% of the built `index.html` (3.27 of 3.29 MiB uncompressed) is that `<template>` block. Fixing this fully would mean moving rows 51+ to a lazy-fetched JSON endpoint instead of embedding them; decided not to do this — 98/100 under an artificially harsh throttling profile is a strong real-world result and the added architecture (JSON endpoint, client-side row rendering duplicating `ShowcaseRow.astro`, losing instant offline search across all sites) isn't worth it for 2 points on a synthetic benchmark

### Home page: fixed false "redirect" indicator

- `ShowcaseTable.astro` showed a `↳ hostname` redirect hint whenever `r.finalUrl` was set at all, with no comparison to the original hostname — a bare trailing-slash normalization (e.g. `aureliendossantos.com` → `aureliendossantos.com/`) was enough to trigger it, wrongly implying the site had moved off its own domain
- Added the same hostname comparison (`www.` stripped) already used by the admin queue's `renderRow`, so the hint only appears for genuine cross-domain redirects

### `db:report` — `--lost-astro` report

- New report: finds sites whose latest scan shows `astro_detected = 0` but had an earlier scan with `astro_detected = 1` — catches migrations across any scan gap, not just the last two scans (unlike the existing `--changes` report)
- For each, compares mobile PSI performance from the last scan while still Astro against the most recent PSI run, so a platform switch's before/after performance impact is visible in one pass
- Folded into `--all`
- Fixed a false-positive comparison bug: the PSI lookup originally joined on `psi_runs.scan_id`, but a PSI run's `scan_id` only records which scan _triggered_ it — the actual fetch (`fetched_at`) can lag hours behind, long enough for a site to migrate off Astro in between. Switched the "before" cutoff to compare against the real `fetched_at` timestamp vs. the last-Astro scan's `scanned_at` instead

### Showcase PRs — astro.build fork

- **PR #2510** — removed 11 sites confirmed migrated to Next.js (`/_next/static/`, `__NEXT_DATA__` on all 11), same format as the merged Framer PR (#2494): YAML + webp deleted, domains added to `blockedOrigins`
- **PR #2460** — resolved a merge conflict in `scripts/update-showcase.mjs` after syncing the fork with upstream (which had merged both PR #2459 and #2494's `blockedOrigins` entries in the interim); rebased with all entry sets preserved and force-pushed

### Insights page — Starlight version legend

- Recency bands were hardcoded assuming v0.39 was latest; Starlight is now on v0.41.3 — shifted all bands up by the same two-version offset: `v0.39–v0.41 (recent)`, `v0.34–v0.38`, `v0.30–v0.33`, `v0.27–v0.29`, `v0.26 and older`

## 2026-06-26

### Framework secondary detection + CMS false-positive fixes

- Added `framework` field to `CmsResult`, populated when a JS framework (Next.js, SvelteKit, etc.) is detected alongside a primary CMS — shown as a secondary badge in `ShowcaseTable.astro`; "JS Frameworks" filter count now includes sites with `framework` set as well as `cmsType === "framework"`
- Fixed parked-demotion logic to not suppress `Forwarded` entries (was incorrectly grouped with parked/for-sale pages)
- Fixed false GoDaddy-parked classification for real Astro sites that happened to mention GoDaddy in page content
- Tightened detection rules that were matching on bare domain mentions in body text rather than actual platform signals:
  - Builder.io, Kontent.ai: now require CDN/API/SDK-specific URLs, not a bare domain mention (was flagging sites like docs.astro.build and our own site)
  - Hygraph, Crystallize, Wix, Ghost, Caisy: CDN-only matches
  - Strapi, Tina CMS, Keystatic: platform-specific globals/paths only
  - WordPress `/uploads/` rule: same-origin only (was matching partner logo URLs in unrelated JSON-LD)
  - DatoCMS: dropped the `dato-cms` class-name match
  - Drupal (medium confidence): added `Drupal.settings` as an alternative signal
- Demoted `full-site` CMS classifications (not just `parked`) when Astro is confirmed — fixes false WordPress-full-site hits on Astro sites that are _about_ WordPress migration (e.g. a WP→Astro conversion tool)

### Showcase PRs — astro.build fork

- **PR #2494** — removed 7 sites confirmed migrated to Framer (`/_framer/` asset path, `__framer_*` globals), submitted and merged

## 2026-06-12 (continued)

### SEO, site naming, and layout

- Renamed site to "Astro Showcase — What CMS? How Fast?" across siteMetadata, all page titles, and meta descriptions
- Fixed `.wrapper` max-width token: `compositions/wrapper.css` had a hardcoded `80rem` cap in its `clamp()` that ignored `--max-content-width`; updated to use `var(--max-content-width, 80rem)` so the token in `_tokens.css` takes effect
- Insights page: fixed charts not rendering after view transition — wrapped Chart.js init in a function called on both load and `astro:page-load`, with `Chart.getChart().destroy()` before re-creating

## 2026-06-12

### Data refresh — scan #11, CrUX and PSI updated

- Switched `.showcase-cache` back to upstream `withastro/astro.build` `main` (was on PR branch `update-redirected-showcase-urls`) — data now reflects the live showcase, not our unmerged changes
- Pulled 2 upstream commits: 6 sites removed from showcase (alexliesenfeld.github.io, antstack, internetoflife.org, offerte.be, portfolio-yuri.vercel.app, rodydavis.github.io)
- Re-ran `pnpm detect` (scan #11): 2,624 sites processed, 72 newly confirmed Astro, 39 dropped, 36 new showcase additions
- Fixed `crux.mjs --new-only` bug: was skipping only sites fetched _today_ (date-based filter) rather than sites with _any_ existing result — rewrote to query `SELECT DISTINCT site_id, form_factor FROM crux_results` with no date filter; matches the correct behaviour already in `psi.mjs`
- Fixed corrupted entry in `cms-results.json`: "Hischool" record had `astroVersion`, `starlightVersion`, and `astroSignals` fields truncated mid-write; manually repaired and validated
- Ran `pnpm crux --new-only` and `pnpm psi -- --new-only` to collect data for newly detected sites
- CrUX page query rewritten to use `MAX(run_id)` CTE per site × form_factor (same pattern as PSI) instead of filtering to a single `run_id` — fixes page showing only 2 entries after an incremental CrUX run
- PSI page: added two new stat cards — `Score ≥ 720 / 800` and `Perfect 800 / 800`
- CrUX page: widened CLS column to `7ch`, trimmed CWV to `5ch`

## 2026-06-11 (continued)

### UI polish — stat cards, toolbar, footer, social cards

- Added CSS rating tokens `--rating-good/mid/poor` and `*-bg` variants to `_tokens.css`; updated `.score`, `.metric`, and `.legend` classes in `_data-table.css` and `_data-page.css` to use them
- Added `.page-lead` style to `_data-page.css` (`step-0`, full text colour) alongside existing `.page-desc`; applied to CrUX, PSI, and insights pages
- Stat cards made consistent across all pages (index, insights, CrUX, PSI) via shared `_data-page.css` styles — removed local overrides on index and insights pages
- `stat-card--pass` simplified to colour the stat value green via `--rating-good`
- Footer: added Netlify and Astro badges (flex row, `height="45"`) before the GitHub link
- ShowcaseTable: reduced `.col-site` from `auto` to `35ch` to stop pushing the Conf column right
- ShowcaseToolbar: moved search input onto its own line, left-aligned; fixed `align-items` bleed-through from shared layer
- Fixed broken column sort on the home page table (removed stale `.sort-icon` querySelector calls)
- OG social cards: updated home card stats (2,633 sites, 2,133 Astro confirmed); created new dark-theme cards for CrUX (`og-crux.png`) and PSI (`og-psi.png`) pages; images generated via Playwright screenshot

## 2026-06-11

### Run duration tracking

- Added `finished_at` and `duration_ms` columns to `psi_runs` and `crux_runs` tables, matching the pattern already used by `scans`
- Both scripts capture `Date.now()` before the fetch loop and UPDATE the run row on completion
- Migration is automatic: `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` wrapped in try/catch runs on every startup so existing DBs are upgraded silently
- Duration is printed in the completion summary line: `Duration: N.N min`
- Fixed PSI estimated time: was based on delay-only (700ms/job); now uses 22s/job derived from actual run 3 & 4 data (PSI runs Lighthouse remotely — response time dominates)

### PSI `--errors-only` flag

- `pnpm psi -- --errors-only` retries only site × strategy combos with `status = 'error'` in `psi_results`
- `--new-only` already skipped errors (treated them as done) — `--errors-only` is the complement
- Updated `--new-only` description in usage comment to clarify it skips both successes and errors
- README updated with new flag

### README & scripts

- Commands table now includes all scripts: `dns-check`, `make-prs`, `db:init`, `db:report`, `preview`, `deploy`, `deploy:draft`, `clean`, `purge`
- Added `### pnpm db:init` section documenting the idempotent DB initialisation
- Corrected `make-prs` description: prepares branches and saves PR body for manual submission (does not auto-create PRs)

### PR #2460 — showcase URL updates

- Applied delucis's suggested title change: `eva.town.yml` `title: Eva Decker` → `title: Ky Decker`
- Resolved merge conflict with PR #2459 (both inserted into `blockedOrigins` at the same point); rebased onto main with both entry sets preserved
- Pushed updated branch to fork

## 2026-06-10 (continued 3)

### CrUX page — Astro-only filter

- Restricted CrUX results to sites where `astro_detected = 1` in the latest scan — 528 → 514 sites (14 removed that had CrUX data but no confirmed Astro fingerprint)
- Changed `LEFT JOIN scan_results` to `INNER JOIN` now that the filter requires a matching scan row

### Pagination refactor

- Extracted `renderPagination` into `ShowcasePagination.astro` as an `is:inline` script with signature `(container, total, page, pageSize, onPageChange)` — removes ~80 lines of duplicate CSS and ~30 lines of duplicate JS from `crux.astro`
- `ShowcasePagination` now accepts an `id` prop (default `"pagination"`) so the CrUX page can use `id="crux-pagination"` without a separate component

### README

- Added dedicated sections for `pnpm detect`, `pnpm crux`, `pnpm psi`, and `pnpm db:report` with all flags and options documented

## 2026-06-10 (continued 2)

### CrUX page — table layout polish

- Added `<colgroup>` with explicit `<col>` width elements so `table-layout: fixed` distributes all three device groups identically — previously the colspan group headers caused uneven distribution, making Tablet wider than Desktop and Phone
- Switched to IBM Plex Sans (`var(--font-ibm-plex)`) on the CrUX table; added `table-layout: fixed` to prevent layout shift on sort
- Replaced `min-width`/`max-width` pixel values with `ch`-unit fixed widths (`col-site: 28ch`, `col-ver: 8ch`, metric columns: `col-lcp: 6ch`, `col-inp: 7ch`, `col-cls: 6ch`, `col-cwv: 6ch`)
- Set explicit `width: 25ch` on `.col-group-header` (sum of 4 metric cols) so group headers span exactly their columns
- CWV column: widened to `6ch`, added `padding-inline-end` breathing room before the next group's rule, `font-size: var(--step--2)` to keep ✓/✗ symbols compact
- Removed background colours from metric cells — rating now shown via text colour only (green/amber/red)
- Added `col-lcp`, `col-inp`, `col-cls`, `col-cwv` classes to subheader `<th>` and data `<td>` elements for consistent width application

## 2026-06-10 (continued)

### CrUX page

- Added `/crux/` page showing Chrome UX Report field data for 528 confirmed Astro sites
  - Columns: site, Astro version, Desktop/Phone/Tablet — LCP, INP, CLS, CWV pass
  - Metric cells colour-coded by rating (green/amber/red)
  - Sortable columns: all metrics sort no-data rows to the bottom regardless of direction; CWV sorts pass → fail → no-data
  - Search filter by site name or URL
  - Pagination at 50 per page, matching home page style
  - Note explaining sparse tablet data: iPad + Safari dominance means CrUX tablet coverage reflects Chrome-on-Android usage only
  - Zebra-stripe rows, `border-top` row rules and `2px` column group separators matching home page table style
- Added "CrUX CWV" link to site nav

### UI

- Fixed Astro version column sort: sites with no Astro detected now always group at the bottom regardless of sort direction (ascending or descending)
  - Previously, negating the comparison for descending order also flipped the null-handling, scattering no-version rows to the top
  - Fix uses an explicit rank (0 = detected + version, 1 = detected + no version, 2 = not detected) applied before the directional comparison, using `data-astro` to distinguish "detected but no version" from "not detected at all"

### PSI & CrUX data collection

- Added `scripts/psi.mjs` — PageSpeed Insights script for all confirmed Astro sites from the latest scan
  - Fetches Lighthouse scores (performance, accessibility, best-practices, SEO) for both mobile and desktop strategies
  - Captures lab metrics (LCP, CLS, TBT) and field data from `loadingExperience` (LCP, INP, CLS p75 + CWV category)
  - Writes to new `psi_runs` + `psi_results` tables in `.scan-history.db`
  - Rate-limited at 700ms between requests (~85/min); estimated ~100 min for full run (~2,100 sites × 2 strategies)
  - `--new-only` flag skips already-tested site × strategy combos for safe resume after interruption
  - `--strategy=mobile|desktop`, `--limit=N`, `--dry-run` flags
- Added `scripts/crux.mjs` — Chrome UX Report script for all confirmed Astro sites from the latest scan
  - Fetches 28-day real-user field data (LCP, CLS, INP, FCP, TTFB) at origin level for PHONE, DESKTOP, TABLET
  - Tries bare domain first; falls back to `www.` prefix on 404 (genuine low-traffic sites recorded as `no-data`)
  - Writes to new `crux_runs` + `crux_results` tables in `.scan-history.db`
  - Rate-limited at 500ms between requests (~120/min, safely under 150/min CrUX quota); estimated ~53 min for full run
  - `--new-only` skips site × form_factor combos already fetched today
  - `--form-factor=PHONE|DESKTOP|TABLET`, `--limit=N`, `--dry-run` flags
- Added `pnpm psi` and `pnpm crux` scripts to `package.json`
- Added `.env` with `PAGESPEED_API_KEY` and `CRUX_API_KEY` (gitignored)

### Admin review UI — middleware fix

- Fixed `/admin/api/*` routes returning Astro's 404 page in the local dev server
  - Root cause: Astro's `trailingSlashMiddleware` uses `stack.unshift()` to position itself before all Vite connect middleware; with `trailingSlash: "always"`, it rejects paths without a trailing slash (e.g. `/admin/api/queue`) before our middleware could run
  - Fix: on the `'listening'` event, steal the HTTP server's `'request'` event — capture connect's listeners, remove them, re-register a dispatcher that routes `/admin*` directly to our handler and passes everything else to connect unchanged
  - This bypasses the entire Vite/Astro connect stack for admin routes, making it independent of middleware ordering
- Removed `enforce: "pre"` from the plugin (no longer needed with the HTTP-level intercept)

## 2026-06-10

### Code cleanup

- Deleted unused `src/components/global/Link.astro` (not imported anywhere)
- Removed `astro-icon` from `package.json` (unused dependency)
- Added `.fallowrc.json` — suppresses `@astrojs/compiler-rs` false positive (Astro internal peer dep, not directly imported)

### Refactor (`scripts/detect-cms.ts`)

- Extracted `makeParkedDetector(cms, htmlPattern, hostnamePattern)` helper — eliminates repeated parked-domain detector structure across GoDaddy, Sedo, Dan.com, and Afternic entries
- Split 297-line `main()` into four focused helpers:
  - `ensureShowcaseCache()` — git clone/pull logic for the `.showcase-cache/` directory
  - `processSite()` — per-site fetch, fingerprint, and result assembly (was a complex anonymous arrow in the queue)
  - `printSummary()` — CMS frequency table printed after each run
  - `printChanges()` — diff report comparing current run against previous results

## 2026-05-27 (continued)

### Scan history database

- Added local SQLite scan-history database (`.scan-history.db`, gitignored, never deployed)
- Installed `better-sqlite3` as a dev dependency; approved native build in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`
- New scripts:
  - `scripts/db-utils.ts` — shared `openDb()` / `writeScanToDb()` helpers; auto-creates schema on first use
  - `scripts/db-init.ts` — one-time setup and health check (`pnpm db:init`)
  - `scripts/db-report.ts` — query CLI (`pnpm db:report`)
- `detect-cms.ts` now writes every completed scan to the DB automatically (non-fatal — a DB error never breaks a scan)
- Three tables: `scans` (one row per run), `sites` (stable site registry), `scan_results` (one row per site per scan)
- `pnpm db:report` — default shows scan history table
- `pnpm db:report --errors` — sites that errored in 3+ of the last 5 scans (configurable via `--min` and `--scans`)
- `pnpm db:report --changes` — CMS / Astro changes between the last two scans
- `pnpm db:report --decay` — Astro sites grouped by major version, flags v1–v3 specifically
- `pnpm db:report --site <hostname>` — full per-scan history for one site
- `pnpm db:report --all` — runs all reports in sequence
- Existing `cms-results.json` backfilled as scan #1 on first run

### Sort fix

- Fixed Astro version sort (and all column sorts) in the deployed site: `applyView` now reorders rows in the DOM via `tbody.appendChild` in sorted order before applying show/hide, so visible rows appear in correct sequence rather than original JSON insertion order

### Detection (second pass)

- Added Substack detection via `substackcdn.com` and `substack.com/publish` (`full-site`, high confidence) — catches sites that have redirected their custom domain to a Substack publication
- Type column in results table now shows "Redirected domain" vs "Parked domain" separately — previously both labelled "Parked / Forwarded"

### Detection (first pass)

- Fixed Blocked + Astro version contradiction: when `astroDetected` is true, a "Blocked" CMS label (from a Cloudflare challenge overlay on top of real HTML) is now demoted to Unknown. Previously the fix only applied when `astroVersion` was present — updated to use `astro.detected` so sites with signals but no version number (e.g. 1vps.com) are also corrected. Blocked sites dropped from 179 → 39 across the dataset
- Fixed SvelteKit false positive: `\bsveltekit\b` was matching the word in marketing copy. Removed the bare-word match; SvelteKit is now detected only via `__sveltekit_`, `data-sveltekit-`, and `svelte-announcer`
- Added VitePress detection via `<meta name="generator" content="VitePress ...">` (`static-gen` type)

### UI

- CMS column now shows meaningful status badges instead of internal labels:
  - "Blocked" → **Bot-protected** (yellow) — Cloudflare or similar challenge detected
  - "Error" → **Fetch error** (grey) — site unreachable at scan time
  - "Forwarded" → **Redirected** (blue) — domain redirects to a different hostname
  - Unknown and parked entries show nothing
- Breakdown list now filters to actual CMS/framework types only (`headless-cms`, `page-builder`, `full-site`, `framework`, `static-gen`) — Forwarded, Parked, and Unknown entries no longer appear
- Toolbar: split single "Parked" button into two distinct filters:
  - **Redirected domains** (blue) — filters by `cms === "Forwarded"`
  - **Parked domains** (yellow) — filters genuinely parked/expired domains only

### PR workflow (withastro/astro.build)

- First PR merged: [#2409](https://github.com/withastro/astro.build/pull/2409) — removed 77 sites no longer running Astro (76 confirmed migrations + jak2k.schwanenberg.name per issue #2408)
- All removed domains added to `blockedOrigins` in `scripts/update-showcase.mjs` so weekly CI skips re-checking them
- PR process documented in `REVIEW-NOTES.md`

### Detection

- Broadened Astro signals from 5 to 8, drawing on patterns from [isAstro](https://github.com/OliverSpeir/isAstro) by Oliver Speir:
  - `data-astro-*` attributes (previously only `data-astro-cid-*`)
  - `:where(.astro-*)` CSS selector blocks
  - `astro-` prefixed scoped class names on elements
- Expanded bot-challenge detection beyond Cloudflare: `cdn-cgi/challenge-platform`, `_cf_chl_opt`, `cf-spinner`, sgcaptcha redirect patterns
- Added cookie-collection redirect handling: sites that issue cookies on the initial redirect are now fetched in two passes (manual → collect cookies → follow with cookies), rescuing sites previously seen as bot-blocked
- Added `starlightVersion` extraction from generator meta tag — scraped for all Starlight sites
- Scan diff report: after each full run, prints newly detected Astro sites, sites no longer detected, version changes, and CMS changes compared to the previous results file

### Insights page

- Added Starlight version distribution doughnut chart — groups 241 Starlight sites into recency bands:
  - v1+ / v0.37–v0.39 (recent) / v0.32–v0.36 / v0.28–v0.31 / v0.25–v0.27 / v0.24 and older
- Renamed "No version" label to "unknown" throughout
- Fixed stacked bar chart title: "Submission year vs Astro version in use" (was "vs current version", which implied the latest Astro release)
- Doughnut tooltips now show percentage alongside count
- Switched to single-column chart layout (was two-column grid)
- Consistent frontmatter structure (`meta` object, `Layout` alias) matching `index.astro`

### UI

- Per-row isAstro test link in results table: hovering any row reveals a `test ↗` link that opens `isastro.pages.dev/?url=<hostname>` in a new tab
- Table bottom-border fix: switched `td` from `border-bottom` to `border-top` so the last visible row on any paginated page never shows a trailing rule
- Table key added below results explaining the orange full-site row highlight
- Homepage About section: brief description of what the site does, link to submit to the Astro Showcase, and expandable "About this data" details block

### Bug fixes

- Fixed SvelteKit false positive: `\bsveltekit\b` was matching the word in marketing copy on non-SvelteKit sites (e.g. "deploy SvelteKit apps with ease"). Removed the bare word match; SvelteKit is now detected only via `__sveltekit_`, `data-sveltekit-`, and `svelte-announcer` — all runtime-injected signals that don't appear in body text
- Added VitePress detection (`<meta name="generator" content="VitePress ...">`) as `static-gen` type

### Acknowledgements

- Astro detection logic informed by [isAstro](https://github.com/OliverSpeir/isAstro) — Oliver Speir's standalone Astro detector

## 2026-05-17

### Deployment

- Site live at [astro-what-cms.netlify.app](https://astro-what-cms.netlify.app)

### Detection

- Added JS framework detection: Next.js (Pages Router `__NEXT_DATA__` and App Router `__next_f`, `/_next/static/`), Nuxt (`id="__nuxt"`, `__NUXT_DATA__`, `/_nuxt/`), SvelteKit (`__sveltekit_`, `data-sveltekit-`, `svelte-announcer`), Remix (`__remixContext`, `/_build/entry.client.`)
- Added `framework` CMS type to taxonomy alongside `headless-cms`, `page-builder`, `full-site`, `static-gen`
- Added Starlight as a detected CMS (`static-gen` type); Starlight generator tag now also counts as an Astro signal
- Fixed generator meta tag matching for minified HTML where `content` attribute appears before `name` (e.g. `<meta content="Astro v5" name=generator>`) — replaced regex with `hasGeneratorTag()` using `matchAll`
- Fixed WordPress detection: `wp-content/uploads/` alone no longer triggers `full-site`; only `wp-content/themes/`, `wp-content/plugins/`, and `wp-includes/` confirm a full WordPress render
- Added Cloudflare challenge detection (`cf-mitigated: challenge`, `cf_chl_opt`, "Just a moment" title + `cf-ray` header)

### Astro detection signals

Five independent signals used to confirm Astro:

1. Generator meta tag (`<meta name="generator" content="Astro ...">`)
2. Starlight generator tag (Starlight is Astro-native)
3. `data-astro-cid-*` scoped CSS attributes
4. `/_astro/` asset paths
5. `<astro-island>` element

### Showcase data management

- `pnpm detect` now auto-clones `withastro/astro.build` as a sparse checkout into `.showcase-cache/` on first run; subsequent runs do a `git pull` to pick up new entries
- Sparse checkout scoped to `src/content/showcase/*.yml` only — skips the ~2,600 webp screenshots, halving download size
- Default source path changed from `/tmp/astro-build-showcase` (lost on reboot) to `.showcase-cache/` inside the repo (gitignored, persistent)

### Bug fixes

- Fixed `docs.astro.build` not detected as Astro: the site serves a `<meta http-equiv="refresh">` client-side redirect to `/en/getting-started/` rather than an HTTP redirect. `fetchSite()` now detects meta-refresh tags and follows them with a second request, exposing the real page content

### UI

- Stats cards: total scanned, Astro confirmed, Astro not detected, sites with CMS detected, fetch errors
- Breakdown bar chart showing all identified CMSs (Unknown/Error/Blocked excluded)
- Clickable bar chart rows filter the results table
- Toolbar quick-filters: Starlight, JS Frameworks (filters all `framework` type), Parked, Astro not detected
- Column sorting on Site, Astro version, CMS, and Type columns
- Pagination (50 sites per page, configurable via `showcasePageSize` in `src/config/siteMetadata.ts`)
- Search by site title or URL
- CMS type badges colour-coded by category (blue = headless, purple = page builder, red = full-site, cyan = framework, green = static gen, yellow = parked)
- Orange row highlight for `full-site` rows (sites no longer running Astro)
- "Sites with CMS detected" stat label (was "CMS identified" — ambiguous)
- Removed Categories column from results table

### Refactor

- Decomposed monolithic `index.astro` into three focused components: `ShowcaseTable`, `ShowcaseToolbar`, `ShowcasePagination`
- Shared types extracted to `src/types/index.ts` (`CmsResult`, `ResultsFile`, `CMS_TYPE_LABELS`)
- Pagination styling adapted from real-estate project design system (violet active page, uppercase prev/next)

### Assets

- Added Open Graph social card image (`public/images/social/generic-social-1200x630.png`) — dark background, violet gradient, stats row, CMS type bar strip and category pills
- Source HTML for the card kept at `public/og-card.html` for future regeneration

### Data

- `src/data/cms-results.json` moved to `.gitignore` — it is a generated artefact; run `pnpm detect` to produce it locally
- `sourceDir` field in `cms-results.json` now stored as a project-relative path (e.g. `.showcase-cache/src/content/showcase`) rather than an absolute filesystem path

### Insights page

- New `/insights` page with Chart.js visualisations:
  - Doughnut chart: Astro major version distribution across all detected sites
  - Stacked bar chart: submission year vs current Astro version — shows which cohorts have kept up to date
  - Summary stats: sites on v5+, on v6/v7 (current), still on v1–v3, no version detected
- Chart.js installed as a dependency; data passed server-side via `<script type="application/json">` to avoid `define:vars` encoding issues

### Navigation

- Header uncommented and wired up with site name link and nav
- `HeaderNav` now driven from `siteMetadata.menu` — single source of truth for navigation links
- Astro version column sort updated to use proper semver comparison (fixes `4.9.0` vs `4.10.0` ordering)
- Table column widths fixed with `ch` units and `table-layout: fixed` — no more layout shift when sorting
- Sortable columns show `⇅` indicator by default, switching to `▲`/`▼` when active
- Footer: GitHub repo link and icon aligned right; copyright left

### Analytics

- Added Pandalytics analytics (`netlify/functions/pandalytics.ts`) — tracks Core Web Vitals to Turso via Netlify function
- `Analytics.astro` component added to `BaseLayout`
- Site linked to Netlify CLI for `netlify deploy` with function support
